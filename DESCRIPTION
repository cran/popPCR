Description: Estimates DNA target concentration by classifying digital PCR (polymerase chain reaction) droplets as positive, negative, or rain, using Expectation-Maximization Clustering. The fitting is accomplished using the 'EMMIXskew' R package (v. 1.0.3) by Kui Wang, Angus Ng, and Geoff McLachlan (2018) as based on their paper "Multivariate Skew t Mixture Models: Applications to Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting Data" <doi:10.1109/DICTA.2009.88>.
